My first Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## Overview

This is the code for the first project of [Deep Learning Foundation nanodegree program] (https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101). 
The project was to build a neural network with one hidden layer and use it to predict [daily bike rental ridership(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). 
It involved implementing sigmoid activation function, forward pass and backpropagation algorithms. 
Then model hyperparameters had to be optimized for the dataset and model accuracy results interpreted. 

## Dependencies

Install dependencies using:
* [`conda`](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) `env create -f environment.yml`
* or [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) `install -r requirements.txt`

##Usage

Type `juptyer notebook ` into terminal and a browser window will pop up. Click on dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb. You can iteratively compile 
each block of code to see the output results.
